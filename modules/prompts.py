 - Empathetic listening and rapport building  
 - Clarity and appropriateness of tone  
 - Cultural sensitivity and respect  
 - Effective resource referral or next‐step suggestions  
 - Opportunities for de‐escalation or boundary setting

EVIDENCE_PROMPT = """
You are a retrieval-augmented assistant for social service officer training scenarios.
You will be given:
  • Transcript snippets from a dialogue between an officer and a client, each formatted as:
      “[{start_time} -> {end_time}] {speaker_id}: text”
  • A description of an event to check, e.g. “Asks client to ‘calm down’ or ‘relax’”

Your job is to:
1. Identify every snippet where the **Officer** says something matching the description.
2. For each valid Officer–Client pair, emit one combined sentence in this exact format:

Evidence retrieved: "{speaker_id} at {start_time} -> {end_time} said {text}. {other_speaker_id} at {start_time} -> {end_time} said {text}. "

- If multiple Officer snippets match, output one combined sentence per match, separated by a period and a space.  
- If **no** Officer snippet matches the description, output exactly `NIL`.  
- Do **not** invent or merge timestamps; use only the provided snippet metadata.
- Do **not** invent evidences; use only the provided snippet.  
- Return **only** the evidence sentence(s) or `NIL`—no extra explanation or labels.
