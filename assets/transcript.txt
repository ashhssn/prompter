[1.178 -> 2.68] SPEAKER_00: Hi Mr Muthu, how are you today?
[7.207 -> 25.633] SPEAKER_01: I'm just trying to get through the day, you know. With my mother needing constant care and my kids depending on me, it feels like I'm carrying the weight of the world. Bills are piling up and I just don't know how to manage it all. It's really overwhelming. How about you?
[26.542 -> 35.193] SPEAKER_00: I understand that you are facing this situation with your mother and your children and rest assured we are here to help.
[38.417 -> 59.311] SPEAKER_01: Help? I've heard that before. You sit in your air-conditioned office but you don't understand what it's like for me. My mother is bedridden and I'm struggling to keep food on the table for my kids. I've reached out to so many people and nothing changes. I need real help, not just words.
[59.812 -> 67.844] SPEAKER_00: I understand, Mr Muthu. As for that, how about we discuss on the kind of packages that we can offer for you today?
[70.988 -> 90.03] SPEAKER_01: Packages? What good are packages when I can barely afford to keep the lights on? I need financial assistance, not some vague offer. My mother needs her medication and my kids need food. I can't keep waiting for something that might not even help. You don't get it.
[90.991 -> 114.227] SPEAKER_00: Well, in terms of providing you with cash or money and finance, that is not our responsibility. But what we can do is to actually provide you assistance for your parents, your mother specifically, in terms of her medical bills and for your children, maybe putting them on the financial assistance scheme in the MOE.
[116.688 -> 139.61] SPEAKER_01: financial assistance scheme. I've been through that already. I've contacted so many agencies and they just keep passing me around. My mother's medical bills are piling up and my kids are eating bread every day. I can't take this anymore. You want me to beg? I need real support. Not more empty promises.
[139.63 -> 158.628] SPEAKER_00: No, no, Mr Motu. We are not expecting you to beg. You know, we're here to help you, to provide you the kind of assistance that we can provide and as well, you know, try to understand what kind of situation that you're going through and look at ways that we can maybe mitigate those issues financially.
[162.752 -> 172.148] SPEAKER_01: Mitigate? You think I haven't tried everything? I'm drowning in bills. and my mother needs care. I've been to every meeting.
[172.168 -> 190.335] SPEAKER_00: Yes, Mr. Mutoh, it's important that we maintain our goal here, which is to help you and your family. And I think that, you know, what I can do is arrange you with some financial schemes. How about that?
[191.717 -> 200.205] SPEAKER_01: Financial schemes? I've heard that before. They never work out. I'm tired of waiting for help that never comes.
